# Analysis Of Network Hardening

In this activity, I was presented with a scenario about a social media organization that recently experienced a major data breach caused by undetected vulnerabilities. To address the breach, I had to identify some common network hardening tools that could be implemented to protect the organizationâ€™s overall security. Then, I had to select a specific vulnerability that the company had and propose different network hardening methods. Finally, I had to explain how the methods and tools I chose would be effective for managing the vulnerability and how they would prevent potential breaches in the future.
